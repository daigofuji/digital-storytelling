# **EMBRACE THE FLUIDITY OF THE WEB!**

Instead of page-based designs, we need **design systems**.
---
class: center, middle

# Communication

Visual designers, UX designers, developers (front and back end), editors/producers, managers
---
class: middle

### Without understanding the system...
* Misunderstanding
* Inconsistencies
* Duplicated or extra work
---

class: center, middle

###How to avoid that?

---

class: center, middle

##We need to take inventory of our design

# Front-end Style Guide or<br> Pattern Library

---
class: middle

### Benefits of a Web-based Pattern Library 

* Being able to **test** responsive design
* Improved **workflow** .small[(Iterative process)]
* Shared **vocabulary** .small[(“What do you call it?”)]
* **Future** reference .small[(“What needs to be coded next?”)]

.small[Adapted from [Front-end Style Guides](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/) by Anna Debenham]

---
class: middle

## Examples of front-end style guides

* [**Lonely Planet**](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/) .small[rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/] 
* [**BBC**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel) .small[bbc.co.uk/gel]

---
class: middle

## But...

* **Time consuming** to create
* Seen only as **developer's tool**
* Often too **abstract**
* Often too **incomplete** and/or **out-of-date**

---
class: middle

### **Tools** that are available:
* [Pattern Primer](http://patternprimer.adactio.com/)
* [Style Guide Boilerplate](http://bjankord.github.io/Style-Guide-Boilerplate/)
* [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/)
* [Living Styleguide](http://livingstyleguide.org/)
* [Document CSS](http://documentcss.com/)
* ... and a lot [more](https://github.com/daigofuji/styleguide-generators)!

## **Atomic Web Design** and **Pattern Lab** helped us with those problems

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Atomic Web Design

---
class: middle, center

## Need for system and “pattern library” for reference

---
class: middle, center, white
### **Atomic Web Design**
[http://patternlab.io/about.html](http://patternlab.io/about.html)

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

.small[Created by **Brad Frost**, the creator of [this is responsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/) pattern library and [Mobile Web Best Practice](http://mobilewebbestpractices.com/)]

---
class: middle, white

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

**Atoms** on the Web are HTML elements like: h1, p, div, button, etc. More abstract atoms include colors and fonts. 

Combining atoms, you get **molecules**, molecules create **organisms**.
---
class: middle, white

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

## Each of them is **on its own, responsive**. 

---
class: middle, white

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

Think of molecules and organisms as **Lego-like building blocks** designed to be combined together.

Combined, they become **templates**, and ultimately **pages**. 

---
class: center, middle
## Every reusable components on our website is now created with **“mobile first”** in mind. 

---
class: center, middle

## What are "Patterns"?

---
class: center, middle

A pattern describes a problem that occurs **over and over again** in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that probelm, in such as way that **you can use this solution a million times over**

# Pattern Lab
---
class: center, middle, white

### Pattern Lab is **an open source tool** to help you create atomic design systems.
![img](img/pattern-lab.png)
**[http://patternlab.io/](http://patternlab.io/)**

.small[Also created by **Brad Frost** and **Dave Olsen**, available on [github](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php)] 

---
class: middle
## What did Pattern-Lab gave us?

- Visual library of building blocks
- View-port resizer and tester
- Annotation and Code viewer

---
class: center, middle
## Tool to create your site's “living” **front-end style guide** or **pattern-library**

---
class: middle

## Benefits of Pattern Lab
* Start conversation (in browser)
* Build better team (by collaborating)
* Create a shared vocabulary
* Focus (through testing)
* Design systems, instead of page-based designs

# Organizing CSS/SASS

---
class: center, middle

## Our **main goal** going into the redesign was to write _reusable, flexible, scalable, modular, and pattern-based_ front-end code.

# Object-Oriented CSS 

---
class: middle

## Object-oriented CSS, or OOCSS. 

A term and methodology coined by Nicole Sullivan

[github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)

---
class: center, middle
### Instead of one monolithic piece of code to complete tasks ABC, you’d end up with **each of A , B and C** abstracted into its own object. Now we’d have A which we can combine with either B or C in any order we choose.

  -- _Harry Roberts_ 
---
class: middle

# Two rules 

1.  **Separate "Structure" and "Skin"**
     - Structure contains core of an object and skin extends its visual representation. 
2.  **Separate "Container" and "Content"**
      - Avoid location-dependent styles. 

---
class: center, middle

#Helper classes

---
class: center, middle
## Example: 
```html
    <button class="button">Submit</button>
```
OR
```html
    <button class="button letter-spacing-neutral">
      Button with lots of words in them
    </button>
```
---
class: center, middle

##Example: Spacing helpers 

Use following 3-letter combination for a class name

.small[
`p, m` = padding, margin

`a, t, r, b, l, h, v` = all, top, right, bottom, left, horizontal, vertical

`s, m, l, n` = small(6px), medium(12px), large(24px), none(0px)]

```html
<div class="mtl">margin top large</div>
```
